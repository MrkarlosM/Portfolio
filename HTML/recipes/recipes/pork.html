        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's
          easy to make in the slow cooker. I like to serve the shredded pork on
          toasted buttered rolls. My family's favorite!
        </p>
        <p>
          This pulled pork recipe is tender, juicy, and oh-so flavorful — and
          it’s incredibly easy to make in your slow cooker!

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Oil: This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil
          at the bottom of your slow cooker.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pork: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four
          pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.
        </li>
        <li>
          You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire
          sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich
          flavors.
        </li>
        <li>Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Brown sugar: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness.</li>
        <li>
          Seasonings: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic,
          and dried thyme.
        </li>
        <li>Onion: A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>
          Buns and butter: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to
          make pulled pork sandwiches.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil.
        </li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the Crock-Pot.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily.</li>
        <li>
          Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the
          juices.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns.
